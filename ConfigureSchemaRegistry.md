## Configure the Confluent Schema Registry

The confluent schema registry is located at  ``` /etc/schema-registry/schema-registry.properties ``` and the mechanisms to start and stop service executables are located at the  ```/usr/bin/``` folder. 

The Schema Register needs to know the Zookeeper service to be able to interact with HDInsight Kafka cluster.
